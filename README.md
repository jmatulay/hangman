This game should produce a random NFL team name
 It should allow the user to input guesses by clicking on the related letter in the alphebet
 Each letter choice should then no longer be available whether correct or not
 If a correct letter is chosen it should be revealed within the word
 If an incorrect letter is chosen the Lives counter should decrease by one
 The game ends when either the user correclty guesses all letters in the word or they run out of lives
